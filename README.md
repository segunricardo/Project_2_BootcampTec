# Project-2
## Space History Visualization

"Dude, where's my trash?"

This project consists of a platform that allows the user to track the number of satellites which have been launched since the beginning of the space race. The site lets the user filter satellites and other space objects by type (military, communications, gps, seismic activity, military, private, etc. ) anc ountry of origin. Also, since we are located in Mexico, another javascrip-powered site filters the number of Mexican launches in the past 10 years for the sake of comparison. 

Below, we give a technical description of each parto of the project:

- Present a choropleth map showing how many satellites each country has sent to space.
- Display a 3d map of Earth showing how many satellites have humans placed in space every ten years.
- Create the iframe...
- Graph bars of the top 10 most capable countries in space.
- A quick comparison of China and the USA, and their number of satellites. 
- An interactive website which will allow the user to filter the aforementioned options.
